# TBB - Intel Thread Building Blocks
Intel Threading Building Blocks offers a rich and complete approach to expressing parallelism in a C++ program. It is a library that helps you leverage multi-core processor performance without having to be a threading expert. Threading Building Blocks is not just a threads-replacement library; it represents a higher-level, taskbased parallelism that abstracts platform details and threading mechanisms for performance and scalability.
